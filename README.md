a simple statagy game im working on while learning opengl 3.0 and greater. at the moment it is very early in developmen.
This project relies on GLFW, GLM, and GLEW so you will need them downloaded and linked if you want build it yourself.
If you don't want to build it and just want to try it go to Downloads.
